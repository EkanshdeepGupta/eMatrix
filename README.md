# eMatrix
eMatrix is inspired from [cMatrix](github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix) which is inspired from the screensaver from the 1999 dystopian sci-fi movie [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix). It implements the iconic scrolling-cryptic-green-text-on-black-terminal screen first seen in The Matrix.
